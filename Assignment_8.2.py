#Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
#Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from: http://openweathermap.org/
#Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
#Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
#Use functions including a main function.
#Allow the user to run the program multiple times.
#Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isnâ€™t presented notify the user.
#Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
#Use Python 3.
#Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.
